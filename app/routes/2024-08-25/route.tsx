      <h1>Hello Again</h1>
      <p>This is probably the 3rd time I have attempted to make this blog a thing.  There's always something that just doesn't quite work how I want and then I get annoyed/bored. I am significantly calmer after I write and then only way to write in real sentences is if I publish it to the web.</p>
      <p>I'm back on caffeine for the last couple of days. It's 9:23 PM and for the first time in a very long time I don't really feel tired. I feel like every time I have entered this kind of headspace it has been so quickly dismantled by life circumstances (the most common downer has been illness). It's hard to fathom how good it would feel to make it a full two weeks feeling like I have today and yesterday.</p>
      <p>I wonder and worry if how I'm feeling is just the "high" of caffeine. Will I start to get the afternoon slump? Will I need ever more caffeine to get the feeling I currently have?  Or should I moderate in a way where I make sure that I'm not doing it every single day so that I make sure I can reach for it when needed?</p>
      <p>This week feels like the first week that having a routine feels possible. There's been some excuse for the last couple of months that makes maintaining a regular schedule difficult.  I'm aiming to get to a workout class at 7AM every weekday morning. I started this a couple of weeks ago, but randomly came down with some weird one night sickness that threw me for a loop.</p>
      <p>This new blog is a remix applciation.  I like that I have the flexibility to create anything that I want in a post.  But it is a little annoying having to type jsx for the content when it is exclusively text. When I have more energy, I will experiment with a way to load up a markdown file so it could just be written in markdown.  So far, this has felt like the most likely "blogging platform" that I can stand in the long term. Secondary perk is that it helps me get up to speed on Remix. Unfortunately, my ADHD brain goes "but what happens when you want to replace Remix with your own thing". And that thought is exactly why everything takes me so much longer than it ever should...</p>
      <p>Going to try to write here daily, but I likely need to do it in the morning when I have the energy to do so. I would like to be "creating" much more, but I need to grease up the gears in my brain with some low stakes writing.</p>
