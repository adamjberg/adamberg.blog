It's 4AM in Vancouver and it has been snowing all night long.  My mind awoke promptly for the [Devil's Hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witching_hour) at 3AM and refuses to let go.  

Funnily enough on March 23, 2023 I have a very similar journal entry.  Weirder yet, in that past entry I had COVID and the day after starting this post I tested positive for COVID again.  If you're keeping track that's number 5 for me, with a whopping 4 in 2022, March, May, October, and now December.  Each time leaves me with a lingering cough that lasts for at least a week on top of the roughly 5 days of initial illness, which collectively means I've probably spent at least 40 days of this year sick.

Each time I have missed important events.  It has become commonplace to go many weeks without seeing people with the revolving door of sickness that has been going around. 

In some ways, this "return to normal" has been harder than the isolation of 2020.  

My last "personal" post was just over a year ago when I wrote [NaNoWriMo-vember 2021](https://adam.xyzdigital.com/personal/nanawrimo-movember-2021).  During 2022, I ended up primarily focusing my energy on writing technical posts over on [dev/tails](https://devtails.xyz).  This was enjoyable on many levels, but I feel like it left me feeling like something was missing. 

I have some ambitious goals for myself in 2023 and this new blog is one of them. 2022 began with me [giving up my iPhone](https://devtails.xyz/breaking-up-with-apple) and [resolving to eventually build my own phone](https://devtails.xyz/taking-flight-without-a-smart-phone) in order to achieve the level of balance I need.  Something I still plan to do, but will need to iron out a roadmap for.

Despite the positive impacts removing a smartphone had on my life, I still slipped into the temptations of a smart phone and ended up buying a new iPhone SE.  In the last few months, I have stumbled further in to the grips on the phone.  I wake up and **must** know what news there has been in the 8 hours I have been asleep.  My mind driven by whatever information happens to be presented to me in that moment.  Now my entire day is coloured by whatever information happened to enter my brain.

A couple years ago I joined Twitter.  I was interested in having a place to share some of the things I was working on.  It wasn't long before that little white bird was whispering in my ear.  "Open me" it would say.  "I have an endless number of things to scroll through".  Against my better judgement, I would often give in to this urge.  I could easily scroll through almost 100 posts in just a few minutes.  My lizard brain was somehow satisfied by this, but my real brain knew that every minute of this was weakening me.  

I enjoy writing and sharing, but I do not enjoy aimlessly consuming.  Unfortunately, I've watched enough of the [Mom TV Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mom_(TV_series)) to identify an addiction and recognize that I just might not be cut out for social media.  

I may look into ways to get this to auto-share to certain platforms.  But for now, there's a sense of calmness that washes over me knowing that writing here doesn't suck me in to bad habits I don't want to partake in.

It's tempting to just start firing off all kinds of posts here, but I think that defeats the purpose.  I suspect all of us are drowning in "updates".  Social media has somehow convinced everyone that it is normal to watch "Stories" for everyone you follow every single day.  If you don't, you'll **never** see it again.  This is not sustainable, but this will be pushed down our brains until they explode.  

Instead, I will initially aim to draft up a single post over the course of a month.  This should be sufficiently limiting that it forces me to focus what I am writing about.  It should also mean that it's not overwhelming to come back here after a couple of months and "get caught up".

Like many others around the world this time of year, I enter next year with a very similar objective as last year.  Here's to hoping this is the year I can tame my smart phone addiction.
