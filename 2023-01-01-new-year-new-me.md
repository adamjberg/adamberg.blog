# New Year, New Domain

Welcome to my new domain [adamberg.blog](https://adamberg.blog).  This will ultimately replace my writings at [adam.xyzdigital.com](https://adam.xyzdigital.com/) and I will migrate those posts over here when I get the time.

My last "personal" post was just over a year ago when I wrote [NaNoWriMo-vember 2021](https://adam.xyzdigital.com/personal/nanawrimo-movember-2021).  During 2022, I ended up primarily focusing my energy on writing technical posts over on [dev/tails](https://devtails.xyz).  This was enjoyable on many levels, but I feel like it left me feeling like something was missing. 

This year, I would like to incorporate a more meandering non-technical post into my public writing.  I am aiming for a post roughly once a month.  I don't really have a plan for what will be written about, but if you've read anything I've written in the past, expect something along those lines.

# Covid 19, 20, 21, 22, and beyond

On September 19, 2020 I wrote about [my experience with the OG Covid 19](https://adam.xyzdigital.com/personal/two-weeks-of-covid).  I managed to evade COVID for all of 2021, probably thanks to the fact that most of the world was completely shut down.  

By early 2022, it became clear that rules or no rules nothing was going to stop people from adventuring out into the world.  In some ways, this "return to normal" has been harder than the isolation of 2020.

End of March 2022 I caught round 2 of Covid.  This ended up ruining a planned visit with my grandmother.  The silver lining (if you can even call it that) was that the show we planned to see ended up getting postponed because most of the performers had also caught Covid.

When July rolled around, riddle me shocked to find myself waking up again with a brutally sore throat.  Another week of being mostly unable to get out of bed.  And another couple weeks following that trying to get back to regular life.

Almost like clockwork, another 3 months rolls by and start of October I'm again taken down with illness.  This one extends for a couple of weeks before I finally start to feel normal again.  Surely, I've caught every variation under the sun (or lack thereof here in Vancouver)...

The week before Christmas, a massive snow storm rolls in across North America ruining many people's travel plans (including mine).  (Un)luckily for me, the day after my cancelled flight I again have a sore throat and test positive for Covid.

If you're counting, that's 4 separate rounds of Covid across 2022.  Each one slightly less severe than the previous, but still at least a couple of weeks of low energy and a lingering cough.  That's a full 8 weeks (or 15%) of my year slowed down with illness.

Despite all of this, I'm still in reasonably good spirits.  Each round has forced me to slow down and reflect on what's important in my life.  Ideally it shouldn't take illness to do that, but at least it's something to walk away with.

# New Year Resolution(s)

I have some ambitious goals for myself in 2023 and this new blog is one of them. 2022 began with me [giving up my iPhone](https://devtails.xyz/breaking-up-with-apple) and [resolving to eventually build my own phone](https://devtails.xyz/taking-flight-without-a-smart-phone) in order to achieve the level of balance I need.  Something I still plan to do, but still need to iron out a roadmap for.

Despite the positive impacts removing a smartphone had on my life, I still slipped into the temptations of a smart phone and ended up buying a new iPhone SE.  In the last few months, I have stumbled further in to the grips on the phone.  I wake up and **must** know what news there has been in the 8 hours I have been asleep.  My mind driven by whatever information happens to be presented to me in that moment colouring my entire day with whatever information happened to enter my brain.

A couple years ago I joined Twitter.  I was interested in having a place to share some of the things I was working on.  It wasn't long before that little white bird was whispering in my ear.  "Open me" it would say.  "I have an endless number of things to scroll through".  Against my better judgement, I would often give in to this urge.  I could easily scroll through almost 100 posts in just a few minutes.  My lizard brain was somehow satisfied by this, but my real brain knew that every minute of this was weakening me.  

I enjoy writing and sharing, but I do not enjoy aimlessly consuming.  Unfortunately, I've watched enough of the [Mom TV Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mom_(TV_series)) (the main premise is two moms that are recovering alcoholics) to identify an addiction and recognize that I just might not be cut out for social media.  

I will look into ways to get this to auto-share to certain platforms so those of you that are there can still see when new stuff is posted.  But for now, there's a sense of calmness that washes over me knowing that writing here doesn't suck me in to bad habits I don't want to partake in.

Like many others around the world this time of year, I enter next year with a very similar objective as last year: fighting my smartphone/social media additction.  I'm tempted to go cold turkey again, but eliminating my smartphone is at odds with the fact that I'd like to build better healthier software for it.  Instead I will be looking at having clear dedicated time blocks that I allow myself to "use".  If that makes it sound like a drug, then good, because it very much operates the same way.  

# Concluding Thoughts

I feel like I have more to write, but this feels like a natural place to close this post.  Mostly as a reminder to myself, but also as a bit of a teaser for you, a few topics floating around include: the incoming recession, learning a new language, finding my voice, and self hosting this blog.  Totally possible that my next post covers none of those, but at least that's some kind of prompt for myself next month.

Happy New Year!
