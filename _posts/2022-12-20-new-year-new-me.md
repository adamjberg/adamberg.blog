It's 4AM in Vancouver and it has been snowing all night long.  My mind awoke promptly for the [Devil's Hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witching_hour) at 3AM and refuses to let go.

My last "personal" post was just over a year ago when I wrote [NaNoWriMo-vember 2021](https://adam.xyzdigital.com/personal/nanawrimo-movember-2021).  During 2022, I ended up primarily focusing my energy on writing technical posts over on [dev/tails](https://devtails.xyz/).  

I have some ambitious goals for myself in 2023 and this new blog is one of them. 2022 began with me [giving up my iPhone](https://devtails.xyz/breaking-up-with-apple) and [resolving to eventually build my own phone](https://devtails.xyz/taking-flight-without-a-smart-phone) in order to achieve the level of balance I need.  

Despite the positive impacts this experience had in my life, I still slipped into the temptations of a smart phone and ended up buying a new iPhone SE.  In the last few months, I have stumbled further in to the grips on the phone.  I wake up and **must** know what news there has been in the 8 hours I have been asleep.  My mind driven by whatever information happens to be presented to me in that moment.  Now my entire day is coloured by whatever information happened to enter my brain.

A couple years ago I joined Twitter.  I was interested in having a place to share some of the things I was working on.  It wasn't long before that little white bird was whispering in my ear.  "Open me" it would say.  "I have an endless number of things to scroll through".  Against my better judgement, I would often give in to this urge.  I could easily scroll through almost 100 posts in just a couple of minutes.  My lizard brain was somehow satisfied by this.  But my real brain knew that every minute of this was weakening me.  

I enjoy writing and sharing, but I do not enjoy aimlessly consuming.  Unfortunately, I've watched enough of the [Mom TV Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mom_(TV_series)) to identify an addiction and recognize that I just might not be cut out for social media.  

I may look into ways to get this to auto-share to certain platforms.  But for now, there's a sense of calmness that washes over me knowing that writing here doesn't suck me in to bad habits I don't want to partake in.
